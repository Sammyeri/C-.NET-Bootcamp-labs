        <h2> My Journey</h2>
        <p>My journey into coding was a sudden one. I originally went to college to learn about biomedical engineering, but wasnt quite happy with it.</p>
        <p>Part of the degree program was to take an engineering class that included learning to use MATLab. this was just the surface of coding for me.</p>
        <p>I decided to take a break from college and was made aware of Grand Circus and an upcoming bootcamp. I looked it up and it looked intresting so in the summer of 2022 I started the Full-Stack JavaScript Bootcamp</p>
        <p>I spent the next 6 months learning various skills to develop websites. Upon completion I set out to look for jobs near me. And thats when disaster struck.</p>
        <p>The varst majority of jobs in my area want C# skills, so armed with this new knowledge I started taking the C#.NET course at Grand Circus. And we are now caught up to present day.</p>
